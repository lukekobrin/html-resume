    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr>
        <p>As a gigging musician, I learned to thrive in ever-changing environments. Constantly rehearsing the skill of strategic improvisation armed me with a love for unfamiliarity. With this in mind, I'm constantly seeking new opportunities for dynamic engagement and collaboration.</p>
